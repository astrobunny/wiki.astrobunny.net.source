  - additional syntax

The most important piece of additional syntax in Hibiol is the Wikilink. In the editor simply surround a `CamelCase` word with double square brackets:

    [[Your_Link]]

And you will have a broken link (in red) that you can click on that will bring you to an edit page where you can create it.

Links can only have `CamelCase` with no symbols except numbers and letters and starts with a Capital letter.
