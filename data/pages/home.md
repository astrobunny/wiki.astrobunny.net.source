## Welcome to Hibiol Wiki, the wiki for programmers

In Hibiol Wiki, you run the wiki editor on a machine and then upload the results! This was made so people can create wiki pages and preview them on their PC and then make pull requests to upload new content.

### About Hibiol

Hibiol has lots of features. In fact this wiki you are reading right now is written in Hibiol!

Files are stored as [[Markdown]], so you can just as easily edit the files' text.

Not just markdown, Hibiol has [[AdditionalSyntax]] that lets you draw flowcharts and graphs, and write mathematical equations.

Each page can also have [[Metadata]], making finding related pages easy.

Want a sidebar? No problem. This is a list of [[SpecialPages]] that are used in Hibiol.
