## Welcome to Hibiol Wiki, the wiki for programmers

In Hibiol Wiki, you run the wiki editor on a machine and then upload the results! This was made so people can create wiki pages and preview them on their PC and then make pull requests to upload new content.

Files are stored as [[Markdown]], so you can just as easily edit the files' text.

They can also have [[Metadata]], making finding related pages easy.

Hibiol has lots of features. In fact this wiki you are reading right now is written in Hibiol!
